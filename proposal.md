# Proposal Template - Simple

###### Description
Provide a brief three- to ten-word tagline that summarizes your project 

###### Example
Donate a masternode to Roger Ver

### Overview

###### Description
Summarize the proposal in narrative form, anywhere from a few sentances to a few paragraphs.  Provide background and context related to the need and motivation for your project.  

Include a brief high-level overview of your scope, schedule, and budget as the final paragraph of this section.

###### Example
Roger Ver is one of the most influencial voices in the cryptocurrency space.  What would happen if we donated a masternode to him to try out?

### Scope

###### Description
This section answers the question *what are you providing*, in narrative form.

###### Example
Let's give Roger Ver a mastenode, and ask for an AMA in return.  This is a bold marketing move.  So bold it just might work.  We need to get a hold of Roger, tell him we want to give him a masternode in exchange for some of his time to help him set it up, try it's features, and hold a public AMA.  The address I have provided on this proposal is owned by Dash Escrow, Inc.  Here is their [cyrptographically signed message](dummylink) proving so.  Dash Escrow has been informed of this proposal and will forward the 1,000 DASH to Roger if it passes.

This section provides firm items that you will deliver.

1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2
3. Deliverable 3

###### Example

1. Cryptographic signed message from Dash Escrow 
2. Cryptographic signed message from Roger Ver
  * Will obtain this pending feedback from the community and MNO votes
  * Message will be him agreeing to accept our gift of a an AMA in return for a masternode

### Schedule

###### Description
This section answers the question *when will you complete key milestones*.

###### Description

| Masternode    |   1,000   |    DASH  | He'll love it, and will never go back to bitcoin :)  |
| My time       |      25   |    DASH  | Coordination w/ Ver and reporting to community       |

Now that you know your total schedule and budget, you can divide the cost accordingly.  If the total time required is 2 months and the total budget requested is 100 DASH, schedule your payment terms as **50 DASH per month** for **2 months**

###### Example

### Closing

###### Description
This section provides your closing statements

###### Example
This might be a horrible idea, but that's not up to me to decide, but rather, the masternodes.  I hope it gets funded.  I will make sure Roger is taken care of if it does.
