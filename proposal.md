# Proposal - Community Stipends

Off-treasury stipends for community members to start and maintain small-scale projects

### Overview

##### Background
Dash is an exciting project.  Many people are scaling back their 'day jobs' as their interest grows.  They are spending a lot of time promoting Dash in various ways, but aren't getting compensated for it in a sustainable way.  They could potentially get paid through the treasury, but **the costs and risks are too high for the average contributor to feel comfortable submitting a proposal** to the treasury to financially sustain their efforts. 

This is a *new* challenge, due to Dash's recent price increase.  Just five months ago the cost to submit a proposal was around 40 USD.  That cost recently exceeded 500 USD and will likely be higher in the near future.  Proposal fees are rising to the point where community contribution is falling below it's potential.  Small (but important) projects and grassroots efforts are becoming increasingly difficult to justify.

Dash's price increase, while causing the challenge above, has also made Dash's treasury fund much larger.  If the proposal fee were lower this would likely lead to a greater number of people submitting proposals to the network, but because the proposal fee rises also, the result is *not more community contributors* but rather more funds being directed towards the Core Development Team.  Rather than taking the relatively large risk of submitting a proposal, a large part of treaury funds simply remains unused.  This stunts Dash's growth, and carries the unintended consequance of an over-burdened and increasingly centralizing Core Development Team.

There is currently a proposal to lower the proposal submission fee from 5 DASH to 1 DASH.  I support this effort.  If and when it is passed we will be faced with a different set of scaling issues.  **A low proposal fee with a very large budget will almost certainly lead to more (too many) proposals hitting the network**.  Masternode operators will have less time for each proposal.  They may just accept or reject proposal without thoroughly reviewing them, or they may stop reviewing and voting altogether.  When proposals do pass it will be even more difficult than it already is to hold contractors responsible for their promised deliverables.

##### Summary
This project is a step towards solving the above challenges.  **We propose a program to fund several relatively small "off-treasury" projects**.  This will allow community members to start and/or maintain such projects without having to submit proposals to the treasury, which would be too costly, risky, and burdensome for both contributors and masternode operators to justify, considering the small scopes of work.  This will facilitate treasury scaling in a healthy (more decentralized) way.  Specifically this will:

* alleviate the high proposal fee issue
* lower masternode owner burden
* improve contractor accountability
* justify grassroots community contribution
* promote decentralization
* potentially prepare individuals to work within the Core team

### Scope

The scope of work involves vetting and funding several small, low-risk projects such as community-driven coding projects, marketing efforts, etc.  Funded projects will have their own, separate scopes of work.  Examples of projects that might fit within this program might include:

* Small software projects
* Ongoing meetups
* Regular blogs, vlogs, or podcasts
* Merchant on-boarding

At least ten of this and last month's proposals might have been a good fit for this program.

##### Deliverables

###### Admin
1. Request for (off-treasury) proposals
2. Proof of payment to RFP winners
3. End-of-term results report

###### RFP winners
1. Project proposals (using this format)
2. Own respective project deliverables

### Schedule

This proposal seeks funding for a two-month trial period.  An RFP (request for proposals) will kick things off.  Three proposals will be approved to commence work.  Additional deliverables will depend on approved projects.

##### Milestones

Target milestones are as follows:

* 2017-05-05 - Superblock payout
* 2017-05-08 - Request for (off-treasury) proposal
* 2017-05-15 - Proposal submission deadline
* 2017-05-22 - Admin approves subcontractors, commence work
* 2017-06-19 - Subcontractors report to admin w/complete SOWs
* 2017-06-26 - Admin reports to MNOs/community

Depending on feedback, we will renew this charter with another treasury proposal.

### Budget

The project is targeting a budget of 30 DASH/month for two (2) months, for a total of 60 DASH

|-------------------------|:-------:|:--------:|--------------------------------------|
| Subcontracts            |    50   |    DASH  | 10 DASH/mo * 1 month * 5 contracts   |
| Admin                   |    40   |    DASH  | 10 DASH/mo * 2 months * 2 admins     |
| Services & Contingency  |     5   |    DASH  | See note 1                           |
| Proposal fee            |     5   |    DASH  | Reimburse fee to submit this proposal|
| **Total**               | **100** | **DASH** | **50 DASH/month for (2) months**     |

2. 6-month subscription to slides.com premium, meetup.com fees, etc. for community use + contingency (tipping, unforeseen expenses, etc)

##### Terms

* 50 DASH/month
* 2 months

### Closing

This project will introduce subcontracting relationships to Dash.  Another way to look at it is pooled treasury proposing.  This serves contractors, masternode operators, and the community as a whole.  This provides a way to scale Dash's workforce in a decentrized manner, relieving burdens off of contractors, masternode operators, and the Core team.
