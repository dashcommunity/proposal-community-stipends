# Proposal - Community Stipends

Off-treasury stipends for community members to start and maintain small-scale projects

### Overview

A challenge is emerging in the dash ecosystem.  Dash's treasury is getting larger, more funds are becoming available for Dash to expand, and more people are becoming interesed in working for Dash.  This is putting more and more pressure on masternode owners to effectively evaluate proposals, and the Core development team to hire and manage people.  

Because Dash is such an exciting project, many people are scaling back their 'day jobs' as their interest grows.  They are spending a lot of time promoting Dash in various ways, but aren't getting compensated for it in a sustainable way.  

This project is a further step towards solving these challenges. Specifically, this project proposes to give out stipends to motivated individuals who wish to start and/or maintain small-scale projects for the Dash community. The result will:

* justify community contributor's time
* offload small projects from treasury/MNOs
* promote decentralization
* potentially prepare individuals to work within the Core team

### Scope

The scope of work involves vetting and funding several small, low-risk projects such as meetup groups, community-driven coding projects, etc.  Funded projects will have their own, separate scopes of work.  Examples of projects that might fit within this program might include:

* Ongoing meetups
* Video tutorials
* Regular blogs, vlogs, or podcasts
* Small software projects
* Merchant on-boarding

Nine of this month's (March 2017) proposals might have been a good fit for this program.

### Closing

This project will introduce subcontracting relationships to Dash.  This serves contractors, masternode operators, and the community as a whole.  This provides a way to scale Dash's workforce in a decentrized manner, relieving burdens off of contractors, masternode operators, and the Core team.
